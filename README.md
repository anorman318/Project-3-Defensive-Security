# Project-3-Defensive-Security
Used Splunk to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization

**Project Scenario**  
Assume the role of SOC Analyst on a team for a fictional organization called Virtual Space Industries  
  * VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may launch cyberattacks to disrupt VSI's business  
  * As SOC Analysts, you are tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks on your systems and applicaitons 
  * The VSI products that you have been tasked with moniroting include:
      * An adminstrative webpage  
      * An Apache Webserver, which hosts this webpage  
      * A Windows Operating System, which runs many VSI's back-end components  
  * Your networking team has also provided you with past logs to help you develop baselines and create reports, alerts, and dashboards to protect VSI from any attacks      by JobeCorp  
  
**Day 1**  
Your team will develop a defensive solution utilizing a variety of Splunk tools in order to protect VSI.  
Using the logs of "normal" business functions to:  
* Create baselines  
* Design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards  
    
**Day 2**  
After experiencing a simulated attack your team will analyze their reports and dashboards created on Day 1 to determine whether our defensive choices protected the organization.
